# Dinomometer
This repository contains Python code for the "Dinomometer" project, aimed at enhancing pediatric grip strength assessment. The project focuses on modifying a hand dynamometer to cater specifically to children aged 4-10 years old. The goal is to address the challenge of motivating children to engage with grip strength assessment tools during pediatric rehabilitation. The Dinomometer incorporates design elements that appeal to children to encourage participation, thus the dinosaur theme. Accurate quantification of grip strength in children is crucial for monitoring health indicators like muscular fitness, cardiovascular health, and early detection of certain disorders. The repository includes code for the modified dynamometer and documentation on design considerations, technical challenges, and performance metrics.
